# End-to-End-ML-Pipeline-with-Scikit-learn-Pipeline-API
# Objective:
Build a reusable and production-ready machine learning pipeline for predicting customer churn.
# Dataset:
Telco Churn Dataset
# Instructions:
● Implement data preprocessing steps (e.g., scaling, encoding) using Pipeline

● Train models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest

● Use GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning

● Export the complete pipeline using joblib
# Skills Gained:
● ML pipeline construction

● Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearch

● Model export and reusability
